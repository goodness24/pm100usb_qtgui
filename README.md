ThorLabs PM100USB GUI Frontend for Linux usbtmc device

This python script can visually configure a PM100USB and show the power and temperature data. The power and temperature data with timestamps can be saved in a text file. The program was only tested on a PM100USB by ThorLabs with a Si sensor under Linux Ubuntu OS.
